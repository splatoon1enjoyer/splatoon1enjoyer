# Who I am

I am the founder and administrator of the SDL Foundation, an (unofficial) organization that decompiles Splatoon and develops projects that revolve around the decompilation.

I am a project manager, technical lead and programmer, primarily working with C++ and Rust for low level programming.

For more information about my organization, see: [https://sdlfoundation.com](sdlfoundation.com).
